## ðŸš€ How to Use
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  
2. Run Database tables.sql to create the schema.  
3. Run Inserted data.sql to populate sample records.  
4. Execute other scripts (Stored Procedures, Functions, Triggers, etc.) as needed.  
5. Use the queries (Joins.sql, View.sql, etc.) to explore the database functionality.
